"I came to the conclusion that Motorola is better, because it is better for me, bigger, easier for me to hold it, quicker, but Nokia is easier, faster, cheaper."

**GPT-2 small**

Honda is better than toyota because it is quicker, bigger, nicer. And it has some of the best engines in the market. But it is still competitive. The good news is that Honda is in the very early stages of making the right choice for the sportscar market. The bad news is that Honda is not taking any of the market-leading advantages of Toyota or Honda.

**GPT-2 big**

Honda is better than Toyota because it is quicker, bigger, nicer. The problem is that Honda is not the only one. Toyota has always been the king of the car world. There are a lot of other companies that have created the cars that people love. They do it for the money. But Toyota is the one that has to compete with Honda and Chevrolet. It has to produce cars that people want to buy. I am still not convinced that Toyota will ever get to that level. But it is not impossible. It is just a matter of time.
